# ticket-scraper-personal-project
This program scraped a ticket website for me because I wanted to know when tickets became available. My friends and I 
were going on vacation and didn't want to be without tickets to a great event. I made a batch file and had Windows 
scheduler run the batch file once an hour, only emailing me if the tickets were available for purchase. The program 
ran once an hour until I was walking home one day and got an email from the program alerting me that the tickets 
were ready. The program ran perfectly for 1.5 months before the tickets were released.
